# GrubDash

Thinkful Project: Create an API for a GrubHub inspired clone

> "You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses."

This project was designed to test my ability to build APIs with complex validation. To succeed at this project, I needed to demonstrate that I could do the following:

- Running tests from the command line
- Using common middleware packages
- Receiving requests through routes
- Accessing relevant information through route parameters
- Building an API following RESTful design principles
- Writing custom middleware functions
